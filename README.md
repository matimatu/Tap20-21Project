**This project was part of the "Advanced programming techniques" (aka TAP- Tecniche avanzate di programmazione) exam at the University of Genoa in 2020.**

The project is a toy solution to a library for managing auction sites and consists of the relationships between five components:
- The SiteFactory : creates and load sites
- The Site : creates users and collects auctions,users,sessions
- The User : wins at auctions
- The Session : can logout and create auctions
- The Auction : allows to bid
